    <!--What are HTML Entities-->

    <p>
        Entities are character sequences placed in the text of an HTML document to print out reserved characters which
        may otherwise be interpreted as HTML code by a browser, or&nbsp;other special characters that would be difficult
        to generate with a typical keyboard.
    </p>

    &nbsp; - non-breaking space

    &lt; - less than sign

    &gt; - greater than sign

    &amp; - ampersand (&)

    &quot; - double quotation mark
