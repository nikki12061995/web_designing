    <!--What are void elements in HTML-->
    <p>
        Not all HTML tags are of the same structure. While most elements require an opening tag, a closing tag, and
        contents, some elements - known as void elements - only require an opening tag as they themselves do not contain
        any elements. This topic explains and demonstrates the proper usage of void elements in HTML.

    <!-- void elements are following -->
    <img>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <input>
    <link>
